Shared Dependencies:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used across all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **TypeScript**: Used across all the files for type checking and improved developer experience.

3. **Figma API**: Used in "figma.ts" and "figmaAPI.ts" files for interacting with Figma and executing commands.

4. **Styles**: Read from the Figma file in "StyleReader.tsx" and used in "VariableCreator.tsx", "AliasAssigner.tsx", "StyleSelector.tsx", and "ModeAssigner.tsx" for creating variables, assigning aliases, selecting styles, and assigning modes respectively.

5. **Variables**: Created in "VariableCreator.tsx" and used in "AliasAssigner.tsx", "StyleSelector.tsx", and "ModeAssigner.tsx" for assigning aliases, selecting styles, and assigning modes respectively.

6. **Aliases**: Assigned in "AliasAssigner.tsx" and used in "StyleSelector.tsx" and "ModeAssigner.tsx" for selecting styles and assigning modes respectively.

7. **Modes**: Assigned in "ModeAssigner.tsx" and potentially used across other components.

8. **React Components**: "StyleReader", "VariableCreator", "AliasAssigner", "StyleSelector", and "ModeAssigner" are all React components that could be used across different pages.

9. **DOM Elements IDs**: IDs for DOM elements manipulated by JavaScript functions would be shared across files. The exact IDs would depend on the implementation.

10. **Message Names**: Any communication between different parts of the application (like between the server and client or between different components) would likely use consistent message names. The exact names would depend on the implementation.

11. **Function Names**: Functions defined in one file and used in another would be a shared dependency. The exact function names would depend on the implementation.

12. **CSS Styles**: Global CSS styles defined in "global.css" would be used across all components and pages.
